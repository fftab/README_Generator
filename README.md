## Description

In this assignment, I used NodeJS, Axios to query the GitHub API and Inquirer to generate a markdown file.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the command

```
npm i
```

Once the dependencies are installed, open your terminal to the directory in which you installed the dependencies and run the command
